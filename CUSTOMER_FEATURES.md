## Backend Models Used

The implementation utilizes the following backend models:

### Core Models
- **User** - Basic user information with roles (customer, owner, admin)
- **Customer** - Customer-specific data (address, phone)
- **Business** - Business information and verification status
- **Sellable** (Products) - Products/services with pricing and inventory

### Data Relationships
- Products belong to businesses
- Transactions link customers, businesses, and products
- Saved businesses track customer preferences

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
The backend will seed sample data including:
- Admin user: `admin@example.com` / `adminpass`
- Customer user: `customer@example.com` / `customerpass`
- Business owner: `owner@example.com` / `ownerpass`
- Sample business with products
- Sample transactions

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Customer Features
1. **Login as Customer**:
   - Email: `customer@example.com`
   - Password: `customerpass`

2. **View Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - See personalized stats and quick actions
   - View saved businesses (if any)
   - Check recent transactions

3. **Browse Products**:
   - Navigate to `/products`
   - See real products from the database
   - Use search functionality
   - Add products to cart

4. **Use Shopping Cart**:
   - Add items to cart from products page
   - See cart count in navbar
   - Navigate to `/cart`
   - Manage quantities and checkout

### 4. API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/products` - Fetch all products
- `GET /api/customers/saved-businesses` - Get customer's saved businesses
- `GET /api/transactions` - Get customer's transactions
- `POST /api/transactions` - Create new transaction (checkout)
